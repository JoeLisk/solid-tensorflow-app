# Art Style Transfer model with Tensorflow.js, Solid.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

- inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMq4nAMuqO8
- Tensorflow model: https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization
- more images + features potentially to come! (depending on if the model size can be reduced)
